Mini-project Goals 

This mini project revolves around developing an extended reality (XR) interactive experience or game, which can either be based on virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR). This report will outline the creation of a prototype for a VR interactive wreck-room experience, the VReck Room. 

The focus for this mini-project was to experiment the physics of objects and interactions with these objects in a virtual reality environment, using the concept of a wreck-room. The wreck-room concept facilitates a variety of physical object properties which can be used to create fun and exciting interactions. A wreck-room can also be used to alleviate stress. 

Apparatus 

This mini-project uses the Meta Quest 2 to provide head-tracking and display the virtual reality environment through its head-mounted display (HMD). The included controllers enable controller-tracking, allowing users to move, navigate, and interact with the virtual environment and the objects within. 

The prototype for VReck Room was developed using the Unity game engine, which facilitated building and implementing the virtual environment and its interactive elements.
